# SAP Business One SDK

The SAP Business One SDK enables partners and customers to extend and change the functionality of SAP Business One to create industry specific functionality, develop missing functionality, and interfaces with third-party tools.

- SAP Business One User Interface API (UI API)
A collection of DCOM objects that provide access to forms, form controls, and menus. DCOM (distributed component object model) is a standard interface for object communication in distributed applications. You can create your own SAP Business One forms, and capture events from existing forms.

- SAP Business One Data Interface API (DI API)
A collection of COM business objects and services for updating, retrieving, and manipulating data in SAP Business One.

- User-Defined Objects (UDO)
An SAP Business One feature that enables you to create custom business objects and register them with the application. These objects become part of the application's collection of objects.

- Service Layer
SAP Business One Service Layer is a new generation of extension API for consuming SAP Business One data and
services. It builds on core protocols such as HTTP and OData, and provides a uniform way to expose full-featured
business objects on top of a highly scalable and high-availability Web server.
